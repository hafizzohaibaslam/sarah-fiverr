              An example of his architecture is known as Nido de Quetzalcoatl,
              located in Naucalpan, State of Mexico, finished in 2007. It is a ten
              home construction project. This project had the purpose of building
              apartment buildings in a very rugged topography. The area was filled
              with caves and ravines.

              The rigidness was a challenge for the project, and the location of
              the snake. However, green areas and open spaces were not only
              respected but were also advantageous in order to keep the natural
              characteristics of the place.

              Senosiain integrated the houses to the relief, he did not build over
              it. The residence is a great example of architecture that draws
              inspiration from nature and has minimal impact on the environment
            </p>
            <p>
              The architect worked with the irregularities of the land. Caves and
              oak trees turned out to be challenging but inspiring for Senosiain,
              who observed the natural shape of a cave as a mouth and then, saw an
              animal look. With this in mind, the architect built a magnificent
              165 x 20 foot snake head. The site is a private housing complex and
              it allows no visitors except for AirBnb renters
